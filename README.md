# homecon
Homecon stands for "Home Economics", and is a simple program to manage the financial ins and outs of a typical household <br>
Just download it, extract the appJar folder inside the homecon folder, and given you have python installed, execute main.py<br>
Easy installation of Python3: write python in terminal, and follow the Microsoft Store pop-up<br>
Its just a rapid prototype, written in the worst python you can imagine, that I will use as a guide for a future ERP<br>
<b>Run the start (.bat) file to run the interface of the program</b>
